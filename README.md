A two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertical grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
